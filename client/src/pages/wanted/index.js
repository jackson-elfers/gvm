        <h3>Finding a New Home for Your Car</h3>
        <p>
          I am constantly in contact with car hobbyists, restorers and dealers inquiring about cars they wish to
          immediately purchase. They are typically serious about buying a car, and are almost always reputable and
          honest to work with. If you are not sure what your car is worth, please contact me. I freely share information
          and can help establish a market value and share ideas on how and where to market your car or car collection.
          If you car is not on the list, below please consider contacting me and I will try to find a buyer for you.
        </p>
