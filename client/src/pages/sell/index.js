        <h3>Selling Your Car</h3>
        <p>
          can help you sell your fine automobile using my extensive network of buyers around the world. From years of
          working with car enthusiasts, I have put together a database of qualified buyers who may be interested in
          purchasing your car. These are cash buyers. I have a policy and track record of assisting car enthusiasts in
          an truthful, intelligent and open manner. I have been collecting sports and collectible automobiles for over
          26 years, and value my relationship with fellow enthusiasts. And, I am certifiable, car crazy!
