          I can help you locate a wide variety of classic, vintage and exotic automobiles. In most cases, I can quickly
          provide you information on many cars in your target price range that are available to purchase. I can provide
          you valuable information in forms that are the most useful to you, including a written vehicle description,
          comprehensive digital or still photographs, video and more. If requested, I will create a detailed condition
          report on a vehicle you are considering for purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also work with experienced mechanics who can provide you a pre-purchase mechanical and structural
          inspection. Our inspections greatly reduce your risk in purchasing your next vehicle, and often provide an
          outline of required or recommended service or restoration work for the vehicle.
